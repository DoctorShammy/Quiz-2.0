    <h3>Generally good buildings (tier 1)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Offices
    <br>
    Shopping malls
    <br>
    Airports
    <br>
    Universities</p>
    <p>This because of
    their (vast) size
    their varied use (day vs night) - this means we can shift loads and therefore save more
    their large number of technical systems which usually means greater savings</p>
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <h3>Semi-good buildings (tier 2)</h3>
    <p>Hotels
    <br>
    Schools
    <br>
    Elderly care
    <br>
    Council buildings such as courthouses, and libraries etc
    <br>
    Big Residential buildings</p>
    
    <p>These buildings are not as good as tier 1 buildings, but have proven to achieve good savings because of, for example, their varied use and size.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    Other buildings, like train stations, hospitals and logistics facilities, might also be good buildings but need further investigation, like a technical inventory, before proceeding.
    </p> 
    <br> 
    <h5>What to avoid</h5>
    <br> 
    <p> In order for Myrspoven's myCoreAI to make the greatest impact and provide the greatest savings, it may be good to avoid buildings with an excessively large proportion of VAV (variable air volume), which are often already well optimized.</p> 
    <p> Portfolios with small individual buildings  </p> 
    <p> Unusual indoor comfort buildings like, ice rink, swimming pools, factories and other buildings with specific requirements for indoor climate  </p> 
    <p> Customers with unusually hard requirements for IT-security like military facilities  </p> 
    
    
    <h3> Summary</h3> 
    <br> 
    <p> Go for big buildings with high number of technical systems and buildings using different types of energy types like, heating, cooling and electricity.
    Avoid ice rinks and swimming pools, aim for the big office buildings to be sure of good savings.  </p>
